# Enterprises Need DevOps in order to succeed in being Truly Agile
Having worked in the Enterprise world for just over 3 years, I have learnt a thing or two about being Agile. At least trying to become as Agile as possible has been a true passion of mine trying to improve my little patch in a huge company with many agendas and political complications.

## A Good Situation
I worked in a team where we worked as a DevOps team way before the term had the meaning it has today. Or at least the buzz word today is certainly much stronger than it was when I started 3 years ago.

We had a team where the business' Product Owner was a Software Engineer. He was always just as interested in the details as much as the high level Architecture, Customer Experience and Incident management.

It was a team where Onshore/Offshore was not a hassle. We're people, it worked and we complemented each other.

Operations and Security people were close by to answer questions and guide as well as truly support during major releases when we needed them the most.

## A Bad Situation
For me the biggest problem faced today has been the lack of ownership some of our development teams take when it comes to their work. This is not due to the fact that they are not skilled or they lack care for their work. It’s a much bigger problem caused in the Enterprise context for the work is poorly communicated, and where funding is project based and not long term Product or Capability based.

Projects are funded based on their requirements and priority and how they will impact the customer or bring revenue (hopefully both) and once funded, the requirements are given to the teams for delivery. But these feature teams are only funded by that project during its delivery. The work and the application is then deployed to production and is now “live”. These project-based teams are subsequently put on another project to deliver its requirements and functionality and as always funds and deadlines are very limited. However, the existing application is now handed over to the Operations to manage. At best, the documentations is sufficient to manage these applications in a break/fix manner - usually not.  This way of working means no new enhancements are made, the functionality is "frozen" at the end of the project.

But now when the application faces an ongoing operational problem: diagnosing it requires the team that built it, and they're no longer available. Most times, the developers are contractors and may or may not be in the same company.  The code running in production might not be available.  This  impacts the current running project as people are taken away to resolve such issues, simply because no one else can fix it.

## DevOps T-Shaped Teams

A true DevOps team is a stable team.  It owns the Product that they are delivering and maintaining. There are minimum handovers across to other teams. There are also minimum handovers within the team.

This does not necessarily mean the team will need to be very large in size in order to accomplish all the tasks required for a successful delivery of a Product and Business Capability.

T-Shaped teams are teams that each team member is able to do 80% of the tasks required within the team.

There are many skillsets required within a single team to enable a true DevOps team. Here are a few:
* Product Owner - the business or user representative
* QA (Functional, E2E, UAT, Performance, Security)
* Engineering (Development, Solutioning and Architecture)
* Customer and User Experience
* Business Requirements Engineer (Analyst)
* Operations and Release Management

The Team Members can work together closely and learn from each other. The transfer of such knowledge and skillset not only adds to their experience and improve the self-confidence and motivation towards self-improvement, but also ensure they are kept interested in the work that they are doing and the team they work in. This also will reduce the risk of the members wanting to leave the team or the company.

Having the Product Owner who has the power and authority to make decisions as to which features and work to prioritize next amongst an avalanche of business requests is crucial in making this team a successful one. A product owner without authority is nothing more than a paper pusher that ends up writing a "minimum" spec with hundreds or thousands of line items. It is not easy to find great product owners who believe in the product they own, and have the desire to support and evolve their product over the long term.

The point around authority is an important one for all the roles within the team when it comes to companies that are transforming their ways of working. Many times I have heard Operations Directors mention “embedding” a team member into the teams. This is nothing more than simple sugar coating of the situation, as in most of the time that Embedded member does not have the final call on important critical matters at the hands of the team.  They have to go back to the “mothership” to gain that approval. This does not work and you should avoid it at all costs.  Being part of the team means being responsible for the concern they represent, i.e. ready to launch, testable between consumers, etc.

Implementation of a comprehensive Automated CI/CD Pipeline is not an easy task, but it is much easier to implement than the right Culture and Mindset in the space you work in - so it forms a step wise improvement. Cultural changes and right mindsets will lead to better support from leadership and external elements within an Enterprise. This support will include better funding models where long term values are transparent to the leadership.

It’s only with such implementation and careful thinking that you can become and Agile team who not only delivers working software, but also maintains it as a product and keeps the customers happy.
